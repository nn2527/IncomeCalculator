<!--I want to make a calculator which gives output to help people know their final income after leave and tax deductions. My calculator will let people fill the no. of leaves a peron took and the cost of each leave, plus the % of tax that they have to pay to their govt.
Going forward I would like my calculator to also tell how much tax do people have to pay once they/users fill the amount of total money they earned. This is genuinely a problem -- young people so often don't know the % of tax they are supposed to pay. So, this tool is like a lazy person's guide to tax & final income calculation-->

<h2>Now you can use this S-Calculator to save your time & brain power</h2>
